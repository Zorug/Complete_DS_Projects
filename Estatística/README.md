# Chess Data Analysis: Exploring Player Performance and Metrics

## Overview

This project focuses on statistical analysis and feature engineering using a dataset of chess games, dados_chess_age.csv. The goal is to explore player performance, identify trends, and extract meaningful insights from historical game data. The project demonstrates key data science techniques including data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis of player-specific metrics.

## Key Features
### üìä Data Preprocessing

Handling missing or inconsistent values (e.g., replacing ? with NaN and converting data types).
Transforming string representations of numerical lists into usable formats.
Feature engineering for metrics such as Elo rating differences and game results.

### üìà Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualization of distributions (histograms, boxplots) for metrics like rounds, results, and Elo differences.
Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between features.
Time-series plots to analyze individual player performance trends over time.

### üß© Advanced Analytics

Subsetting the data for analysis of "White" and "Black" players separately.
Calculating and visualizing performance differences between players.
Investigating metrics such as Average CP Loss, Elo differences, and match outcomes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Custom Functions and Iterative Insights

Functions for cleaning and transforming data, such as calculating the mean of a list of values.
Extracting key metrics like the start date of each player‚Äôs career.

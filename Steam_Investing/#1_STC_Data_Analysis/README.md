# Steam Investing - Part 1

## Objetive

The purpose here is not just to understand but to prepare the DataSet in order to suggest booster packs purchases for the resale of individual cards.

There is a logic here, in which each game has a number of cards to close a 'set'. Each booster pack generates 3 random cards from this set. Both booster packs and cards can be sold individually.

The updated CSV file can be found at: https://steam.tools/cards/
